Sentimental Analysis

Initially I have used a python library called TextBlob for textual processing the data. It allows us to perform common NLP ( Natural Language Processing ) parts such as parts of speech tagging, sentimental analysis classification and many other things.
In this program what I'm doing is calculating the polarity of each statement to determine whether the given statement is positive or negative or neutral. 

In this program I'm assigning two strings to two different variables called feedback1 and feedback2.
I have given one negative statement and one positive statement to check how positive or negative they are. Finally getting the output on the basis of polarity and subjectivity.
The polarity measure will let us know how positive the sentence is or how negative the statement is.
Subjectivity refers to personal views, feelings or beliefs.
